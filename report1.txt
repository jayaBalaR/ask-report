🌿 A Journey Back to Roots: Summer Camp at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Anaikatti
( 🧭 Reimagining Summer: A Camp Rooted in Indic Wisdom)

Arsha Seva Kendram organised this immersive summer camp under the able leadership of Acharyas, Dr. Jayakumar Srinivasan Ammangudi and Mr. Srinivasan both students of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, (website). The camp aimed to provide participants with a deeper understanding of traditional Hindu philosophies and practices, creating an atmosphere of community and cultural appreciation. With a range of activities including yoga, meditation, and discussions on ancient texts, attendees were encouraged to explore their spiritual journeys in a supportive environment.

The meaning of “Arsha Vidya Gurukulam”  is translated as “A place of receiving knowledge given by the Rishis”. This nurturing space fosters the transmission of wisdom from ancient sages to modern seekers, emphasising the importance of experiential learning and personal growth. Participants leave with not only knowledge but also a renewed sense of purpose and connection to their heritage.

In an era of digital overload and hyperactivity, 30 unique children, aged 8 to 12 years, with their parents gathered at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Anaikatti, Coimbatore, for a two-and-a-half-day summer retreat that promised something different — a holistic, joyful, and grounding experience in the lap of tradition.
This wasn’t just another summer camp. It was a celebration of Indic living, an immersion into the treasures of the Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS), and a heartfelt effort to reconnect both children and their parents with time-tested values.
